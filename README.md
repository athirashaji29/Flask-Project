**Hackerrzz - Education Predictor**

**Introduction**
Hackerrzz, a dynamic team of passionate coders, participated in a 24-hour coding hackathon with the goal of addressing Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) - Quality Education. Our mission was to devise a solution to predict student academic outcomes using machine learning techniques. We aimed to contribute to the enhancement of education by identifying potential challenges students might face in their academic journey.

**Problem Statement**
Our challenge revolved around a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes such as socio-economic factors, family background, and student performance indicators. The dataset included features like family size, parents' education, study time, health status, and past academic grades (G1, G2, G3). The task at hand was to predict whether a student would pass or fail based on these attributes.

**Solution Approach**
Machine Learning Models
We employed three powerful machine learning models to tackle the prediction task:

**Logistic Regression:** A fundamental model suitable for binary classification problems, which provided us with a baseline for comparison.

**Decision Tree:** Leveraging the power of decision trees, we aimed to capture complex relationships within the data and enhance predictive accuracy.

**Support Vector Classification (SVC):** Harnessing the capabilities of SVC, a robust model for classification tasks, to improve the predictive performance.

**Website Implementation**
Our solution wasn't just confined to the algorithms; we went a step further by developing a user-friendly website for seamless predictions. The website allowed users to input relevant student details and receive an instant prediction regarding their academic outcomes.

**Results**
After extensive experimentation, our models demonstrated promising results in predicting student outcomes. The website provides an intuitive interface for users to input student details and receive predictions instantly.

**Future Enhancements**
We envision expanding our project by incorporating additional features, optimizing model parameters, and exploring advanced machine learning techniques. Continuous improvement is key to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our education predictor.
